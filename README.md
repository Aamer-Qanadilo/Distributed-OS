## About The Project

Bazar.com is a web store designed to be the World's smallest bookstore. It is built using Node.js and allows customers to search for books, view details about them, and make purchases. The project follows a microservices architecture with backend services, utilizing lightweight web frameworks and HTTP REST interfaces. The frontend has been omitted, and the backend services have been thoroughly tested using Postman.

### Key Features:

1. **RESTful API:** All interfaces for each component are exposed as HTTP REST calls.
2. **Persistence:** Data for catalog and order log is maintained in a SQLite database.
3. **Concurrent Requests:** The system supports concurrent requests using built-in concurrency support of modern web frameworks.
4. **Distributed Deployment:** Components can run on different machines in a distributed fashion.
5. **GitHub Repository:** Source code is managed and version-controlled using GitHub.
